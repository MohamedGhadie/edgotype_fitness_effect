To produce PPI binding ∆∆G values using the FoldX method, follow the instructions below. Throughout the instructions, <projectDir> refers to your project directory, and <interactomeDir> refers to the interactome data directory <projectDir>/data/processed/<interactome_name>” where <interactome_name> is the name of the reference interactome you are working on, either HI-II-14 or IntAct. FoldX requires Python 2.

1 - Register for a license with FoldX (http://foldxsuite.crg.eu/products#foldx)

2 - cd <interactomeDir>

3 - mkdir foldx

4 - cd foldx
 
5 - mkdir jobs

6 - mkdir archived

7 - Download FoldX and extract files in directory foldx

8 - cp rotabase.txt jobs/

9 - cd <projectDir>/code.

10 - Produce data files for each job to be submitted to FoldX. Jobs will be saved in the directory “<interactomeDir>/foldx/data”:
python3 produce_foldx_binding_ddg_jobs.py

11 - cd <interactomeDir>/foldx/jobs

12 - For each data folder in <interactomeDir>/foldx/data, run the following two commands: foldx -f <path_to_data_folder>/config_repairPDB.cfg
foldx -f <path_to_data_folder>/config_pssm.cfg
# Where <path_to_data_folder> is the full path to the data folder. FoldX will save results in the same data folder.

13 - cd <interactomeDir>/foldx

14 - mv data/ results/.

15 - cd <projectDir>/code

16 - python3 process_foldx_results.py
