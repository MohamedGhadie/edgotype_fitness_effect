# This file provides instructions to create FoldX jobs for calculating PPI binding ∆∆G upon mutation, and processing of FoldX results. FoldX requires Python 2.

1 - Register for a license with FoldX (http://foldxsuite.crg.eu/products#foldx)

2 - Download FoldX and extract files into separate FoldX directory foldx/. You should get two files: foldx executable and rotabase.txt

3 - Set working directory to project directory edgotype_fitness_effect/

4 - Produce FoldX jobs:
cd code/
python3 produce_foldx_binding_ddg_jobs.py

# FoldX data files will be saved to directory: edgotype_fitness_effect/data/processed/HuRI/model_based/foldx/data

# Job scripts to be run on the computing cluster (in this case the Compute Canada Beluga 
server) will be saved to directory: edgotype_fitness_effect/data/processed/HuRI/model_based/foldx/jobs

# To run jobs in parallel on computing cluster (Beluga), follow instructions 5 to 9 below:

	5 - Upload the two FoldX folders data/ and jobs/ to FoldX installation directory on the computing cluster
	
	6 - Go to foldx installation directory on the computing cluster
	
	7 - cp rotabase.txt jobs/
	
	8 - cd jobs/
	
	9 - Submit each job script to the server

# Alternatively, to run jobs sequentially on local computer, follow instructions 10 to 14 below:

	10 - Copy the two FoldX folders data/ and jobs/ to local foldx installation directory
	
	11 - Change directory to local FoldX installation directory
	
	12 - cp rotabase.txt jobs/
	
	13 - cd jobs/
	
	14 - For each data folder in foldx/data, run the following two commands from the jobs directory:
	foldx -f ../data/<data_folder_name>/config_repairPDB.cfg
	foldx -f ../data/<data_folder_name>/config_pssm.cfg

# FoldX will save results for each job in its data folder.

15 - When all calculations are completed, rename the FoldX data/ folder that has results in it as results/

16 - Copy the FoldX results/ folder to edgotype_fitness_effect/data/processed/HuRI/model_based/foldx/

17 - rename data/ and jobs/ folders in directory edgotype_fitness_effect/data/processed/HuRI/model_based/foldx/ to data_1/ and jobs_1/

18 - Process FoldX results:
cd edgotype_fitness_effect/code/
python3 process_foldx_results.py

# A new data folder data/ and jobs folder jobs/ will be created in directory: edgotype_fitness_effect/data/processed/HuRI/model_based/foldx/. But they should be empty indicating that all results have been processed. If any new jobs appear in these folders, it means they were mistakenly missed in the FoldX submissions. Repeat all previous steps on these new jobs.
