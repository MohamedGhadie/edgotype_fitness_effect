Performing physics-based edgotype prediction for disease mutations

Labeling mutation edgotypes
1068 non-disease mutations
318 disease mutations

Fraction of predicted edgetic mutations:
Non-disease mutations: 0.012 (SE = 0.00335537, 13 out of 1068)
Disease mutations: 0.119 (SE = 0.0181899, 38 out of 318)
Fisher's exact test, p-value = 2.10735e-15 (odds ratio = 0.0907957)
