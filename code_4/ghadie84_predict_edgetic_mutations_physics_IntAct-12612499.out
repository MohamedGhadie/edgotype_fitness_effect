Performing physics-based edgotype prediction for disease mutations

Labeling mutation edgotypes
2843 non-disease mutations
1275 disease mutations

Fraction of predicted edgetic mutations:
Non-disease mutations: 0.018 (SE = 0.00246608, 50 out of 2842)
Disease mutations: 0.071 (SE = 0.00718408, 90 out of 1273)
Fisher's exact test, p-value = 2.47896e-16 (odds ratio = 0.235395)
