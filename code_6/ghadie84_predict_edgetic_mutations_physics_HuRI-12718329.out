Performing physics-based edgotype prediction for disease mutations

Labeling mutation edgotypes
1081 non-disease mutations
318 disease mutations

Fraction of predicted edgetic mutations:
Non-disease mutations: 0.015 (SE = 0.00367279, 16 out of 1081)
Disease mutations: 0.132 (SE = 0.0189862, 42 out of 318)
Fisher's exact test, p-value = 2.36265e-16 (odds ratio = 0.0987257)
