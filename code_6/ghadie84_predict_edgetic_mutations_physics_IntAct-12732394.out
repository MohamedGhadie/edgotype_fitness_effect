Performing physics-based edgotype prediction for disease mutations

Labeling mutation edgotypes
2873 non-disease mutations
1276 disease mutations

Fraction of predicted edgetic mutations:
Non-disease mutations: 0.021 (SE = 0.00264688, 59 out of 2872)
Disease mutations: 0.083 (SE = 0.00772627, 106 out of 1276)
Fisher's exact test, p-value = 1.7574e-19 (odds ratio = 0.231506)
